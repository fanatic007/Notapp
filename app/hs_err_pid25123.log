# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
# Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 85458944 bytes for committing reserved memory.
# Possible reasons:
#   The system is out of physical RAM or swap space
#   In 32 bit mode, the process size limit was hit
# Possible solutions:
#   Reduce memory load on the system
#   Increase physical memory or swap space
